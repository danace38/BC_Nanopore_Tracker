# BC Nanopore Tracker

The BC Nanopore Tracker web application was developed as part of an academic initiative for the Biology Department's laboratory at CUNY Brooklyn College. 

The laboratory's data management practices, primarily relying on Google Sheets and third-party services, present limitations for secure and efficient handling of critical research information. The goal of this project is to deliver a scalable and efficient web application for managing laboratory data, including experiments, runs, devices, and participants.
